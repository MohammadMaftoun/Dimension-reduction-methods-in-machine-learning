This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of dimension reduction approaches, along with implementations and resources for each technique.
Dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed and implemented by using feature selection and extraction methods. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is widely utilized for its ability to maximize data variance along principal components, aiding in feature and noise reduction. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) excel in maintaining data relationships, making them valuable for visualizing complicated datasets. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) focuses on discovering linear combinations of features for effective class separation, especially in classification tasks. Autoencoders, as neural network-based models, also present an unsupervised approach for learning efficient data representations, contributing to manifold applications in feature extraction.
