This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of dimension reduction techniques, along with implementations and resources for each method.
Dimension reduction methods in machine learning play a crucial role in simplifying and optimizing the analysis of high-dimensional data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is widely utilized for its ability to maximize data variance along principal components, aiding in feature and noise reduction. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) excel in maintaining data relationships, making them valuable for visualizing complex datasets. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) focuses on finding linear combinations of features for effective class separation, especially in classification tasks. Autoencoders, as neural network-based models, offer an unsupervised approach for learning efficient data representations, contributing to manifold applications in feature extraction. Choosing the right dimension reduction method depends on the data characteristics and analytical objectives, requiring thoughtful consideration in practical applications.
