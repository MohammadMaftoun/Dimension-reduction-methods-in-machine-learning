This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of dimension reduction approaches, implementations, and resources for each approach.
Dimensionality reduction approaches have been proposed and implemented using feature selection and extraction methods. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is widely utilized to maximize data variance along principal components, aiding in feature and noise reduction. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) excel in maintaining data relationships, making them valuable for visualizing complex datasets. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) concentrates on discovering linear combinations of features for effective class separation, especially in classification tasks. As neural network-based models, autoencoders also present an unsupervised approach for learning efficient data representations, contributing to manifold applications in feature extraction.
